# About Track Fit

<p style="background-color:gray; padding:20px">Track Fit app is designed for those wishing to keep track of their fitness journey. Our app allows users to log various activities they have completed for the day and have them all stored in one place - track page. 
The user is able to update and delete each activity log as well in case they need to. 
The app features login so all information is stored securely to be accessed only by the logged in user.
